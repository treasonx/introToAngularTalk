### (egghead.io)[http://egghead.io/]

Awesome video collection with many tutorials. 

### AngularJS Docs

[API Docs](http://docs.angularjs.org/api/)

[Developer Guide](http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/)

Not the best place when getting started. The docs are complete but sometimes very hard to understand.
